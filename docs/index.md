This library offers a mostly-compliant[^1] XML parser, tree builder and several related utilities.  
It is not intended as a general purpose library, which means it might not be a good fit for your project. Please, read the rest of this readme for more information.  

[^1]: XML 1.0 is covered as a best-effort, but there will be small things where either the official XML standard or this implementation is going to be incompatible or a superset.  
      For more information on compatibility, please check [here](./compatibility.md).
