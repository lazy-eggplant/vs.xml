This library offers a mostly-compliant[^1] XML parser, tree builder, query engine and several related utilities.  
It is not intended as a general purpose library, which means it might not be a good fit for your project.  
Please, read the rest of the [original readme](https://github.com/lazy-eggplant/vs.xml) to know more about its objectives and drawbacks.  
Or continue with this documentation which offers a more in-depth description of several topics.

[^1]: XML 1.0 is covered as a best-effort, but there will be small things where either the official XML standard or this implementation is going to be incompatible or a superset.  
      For more information on compatibility, please check [here](./features.md).
