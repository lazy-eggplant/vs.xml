    The tree structure generated with this library are mostly immutable.  
    This means that it is better to annotate the tree instead of mutating it.
    Annotations can also be serialized and saved.  
    This example will use `glt` as it offerer better containers for this purpose compared to the ones offered in the stdc++ lib, while being interface-compatible.
