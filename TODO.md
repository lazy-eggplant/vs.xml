- Add support for `&#...` escape sequences in xml serialization
- Better ownership handling for the xml parser of the string_view/string
- Support for saving/loading functions of trees without needing serialization.
- Random access to attributes for the iterator.
- Tree builder method to use injection maps when generating the tree.

With these features, the library would be considered complete.
