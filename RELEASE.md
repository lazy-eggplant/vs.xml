Very dense release in terms of features, most of which have been under development for a while but are only now emerging as "complete"!

- Queries on the xml tree are now working! With shorthands and everything.
- (breaking) changes in the binary format to support multi-document archives sharing symbols. No capability exposed to the library yet, but the binary format should be "final"
